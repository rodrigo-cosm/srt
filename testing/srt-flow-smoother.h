    // happened without getting more information about the loss.
    // Things that need to be done are:
    //
    // 1. Exit the FS_WARMUP state immediately - sending with maximum
    //    possible speed might choke the transmission completely.
    // 2. Start doing the short loss measurement (LossSpeed), that is
    //    initialize the index and collect losses in consecutive short cells.
    //    When the FS_SAMPLE_WIDTH is reached earlier (which means that
    //    packet loss is below 25%) it means that the loss is not tragic,
    //    can be measured with the normal measurement process.
    // 3. Do the 4-times loss measurement:
    //    - with every loss, check if the number of lost packets exceed 16.
    //      if so, its treated as a choke point and decreasing the speed must
    //      happen immediately
    //    - Fill the loss information for every range of 16 packets, by
    //      checking the sequence numbers of the loss.
    //    - When filled the whole 4 cells, check the percentage of packet loss.
    //      if the percentage of the packet loss increases, switch to FS_SLIDE.
    // 4. When the loss has no increasing tendency, switch to FS_CLIMB and start
    //    long term measurements.
